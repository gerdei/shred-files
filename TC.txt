TEST CASES

Author: Gergő Erdei
Date: 10th March, 2021

Scope:
The tests are run using Firefox (v 86.0 (32-bits)), it should be extended to all major browser types (Chrome, Edge) if necessary.
The tests verify the behaviour of the cookie notification area, the search field and the Location selector on the site "https://www.community-z.com/communities". There is also a section where the search results are validated using API testing.

The structure of other sites on https://www.community-z.com/ are very similar, the methods described in this document can help to test other functionalities of the page too.

id: TC_search_03

description: The purpose of this test is to verify that typing characters one-by-one into the search field incrementaly filters the search results

test data: h, u, m, a, n, s (characters to be typed in the searchfield one-by-one)

prerequisites: In order to keep track of the number of results before beginning the test visit the site "https://www.community-z.com/communities" and click on the "More filters" button, then click on the checkbox/slider corresponding to the "Online" control. This results a filter content area under the controls, where the number of search results is displayed ("[n] results found for:...") Now (9th March, 2021, 18:45 GMT the number of results is 564)

Steps:

1. Click the the search area and press the "h" key
2. Click the the search area and press the "u" key
3. Click the the search area and press the "m" key
4. Click the the search area and press the "a" key
5. Click the the search area and press the "n" key
6. Click the the search area and press the "s" key

Expected results:
1. the results are automatically filtered (the cards/results are changed), the number of results are changed from 564 to 349
2. the results are automatically filtered (the cards/results are changed), the number of results are changed from 349 to 5
3. the results are automatically filtered (the cards/results are changed), the number of results are changed from 5 to 1
4. the results are automatically filtered, but the card/result is not changed, since title still matches the query, number of search results also remains 1
5. the results are automatically filtered, but the card/result is not changed, since title still matches the query, number of search results also remains 1
6. the results are automatically filtered, tere are no search results, since title does not match the query string anymore, number of search results decreases to 0

Observed results:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.

Status (PASSED/FAILED): 


Note: The number of search results stated in this test case are only valid at a specific time, it can change if users add/remove communities in the future. The goal is to observe the (not strictly) monotone descending nature in the sequence of search results while the user is typing characters into the search field. The test data should also be modified in the future if this nature cannot be observed using the current test data. The other option is to use a test environment where the communities are fixed.

Test cases for search validation:
---------------------------------


The testing startegy used for the validation of the searches (and generally any filter) is based on the following:

1. Typing a string in the search field generates a GET request hitting "https://community-z.com/api/v2/communities.json"

2. The server sends a JSON response, in that response there exists an array named "communities" and the following attributes are listed for each community (search result): ['id', 'title', 'url', 'logo', 'description', 'event_count', 'subscription', 'closed']

-----Note---------
At first I tought that the results are returned if the query string (with trailing/leading/multiple spaces removed) is contained in the "title" attribute of the community, however this is only partially true:

action_1: type "c++" in the search field
result_1: there is only 1 result named "EPAM C++ Community"

action_2: remove the "c" from the beginning, leaving only "++" in the search field
result_2: additional results are added, but "++" is generally not part of the title attribute

In order to get the categories of the community, one must click/visit the page of the community. (https://www.community-z.com/communities/+url from JSON response) This shows the categories associated to the community, however the content is dynamic and can not be directly accesed from the HTML source code. An option could be to use a browser automation tool (Selenium) to get the dynamic content, but after some inspection the content is generated by the hitting the "https://community-z.com/api/v2/communities/{id}/pages/home" endpoint where {id} is the "id" attribute retrieved in the JSON response mentioned in point 2.
-----End-of-Note----

3. If the query string (with trailing/leading/multiple spaces removed) is not a substring of the "title", then one should verify that it is a substring of at least one category obtained from the JSON response ([0][properties][details][categories])after a GET request to "https://community-z.com/api/v2/communities/{id}/pages/home" 

This method can be easily extended to verifying any filter (Category, Location) on the communities page by appropriately modifying the URL parameters of the GET request, and verifying ([0][properties][details][format][location] in the second JSON response.
API testing can be automatically done with Python using the requests module (has to be installed separately) or one can use other tools (cURL) if Python is not an option.
Many Test cases can be generated with a list of valid inputs (search strings, categoies, locations)
